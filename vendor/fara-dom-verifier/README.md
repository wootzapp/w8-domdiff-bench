## Updates

* **2026-04-18** — Removed the `autogen-core` / `autogen-ext` dependency
  from `webeval`; chat completion clients are now self-contained under
  `webeval/src/webeval/oai_clients/`. No more autogen submodule install
  step; just `pip install -e .[vllm]` then `cd webeval; pip install -e .`.
* **2026-04-18** — Incorporated WebTailBench (initial / now-stale
  version) directly into the repo as a first-class benchmark. The
  loader auto-downloads `WebTailBench-v1-rubrics.tsv` from
  [`microsoft/WebTailBench`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/WebTailBench)
  and threads each task's published `precomputed_rubric` through to
  the verifier. Reproducibility CLI lives in `webeval/scripts/webtailbench.py`.
* **2026-04-18** — Released the **Universal Verifier** (`MMRubricAgent`)
  as the official verifier for WebTailBench. Multimodal,
  rubric-grounded, two-model ensemble (`gpt-5.2` + `o4-mini`) with
  per-criterion scoring, outcome verification, and first-point-of-failure
  analysis. A stand-alone parallel runner is at
  `webeval/scripts/verify_trajectories.py` for re-scoring any directory
  of webeval trajectories without touching the solver.

## Overview

**Fara-7B** is Microsoft's first **agentic small language model (SLM)** designed specifically for computer use. With only 7 billion parameters, Fara-7B is an ultra-compact Computer Use Agent (CUA) that achieves state-of-the-art performance within its size class and is competitive with larger, more resource-intensive agentic systems.

Try Fara-7B locally as follows (see [Installation](#Installation) for detailed instructions on Windows ) or via Magentic-UI:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fara.git
cd fara

# 2. Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install
```

Then in one process, host the model:
```bash
vllm serve "microsoft/Fara-7B" --port 5000 --dtype auto 
```
Then you can iteratively query it with:
```bash
fara-cli --task "whats the weather in new york now"
```

To try Fara-7B inside Magentic-UI, please follow the instructions here [Magentic-UI + Fara-7B](https://github.com/microsoft/magentic-ui/blob/main/README.md#fara-7b). You will need to serve the model as before, but instead of fara-cli you can use Magentic-UI which has a nice UI (see video demos below).


Notes:
- If you're using Windows, we highly recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Please see the Windows instructions in the [Installation](#Installation) section.
- You might need to do `--tensor-parallel-size 2` with vllm command if you run out of memory

### What Makes Fara-7B Unique

Unlike traditional chat models that generate text-based responses, Fara-7B leverages computer interfaces—mouse and keyboard—to perform multi-step tasks on behalf of users. The model:

- **Operates visually** by perceiving webpages and taking actions like scrolling, typing, and clicking on directly predicted coordinates without accessibility trees or separate parsing models
- **Enables on-device deployment** due to its compact 7B parameter size, resulting in reduced latency and improved privacy as user data remains local
- **Completes tasks efficiently**, averaging only ~16 steps per task compared to ~41 for comparable models

Fara-7B is trained using a novel synthetic data generation pipeline built on the [Magentic-One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/) multi-agent framework, with 145K trajectories covering diverse websites, task types, and difficulty levels. The model is based on [Qwen2.5-VL-7B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13923) and trained with supervised fine-tuning.

### Key Capabilities

Fara-7B can automate everyday web tasks including:
- Searching for information and summarizing results
- Filling out forms and managing accounts
- Booking travel, movie tickets, and restaurant reservations
- Shopping and comparing prices across retailers
- Finding job postings and real estate listings

### Performance Highlights

Fara-7B achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple web agent benchmarks, outperforming both comparable-sized models and larger systems:

### WebTailBench: A New Benchmark for Real-World Web Tasks

We are releasing **[WebTailBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/WebTailBench)**, a new evaluation benchmark focusing on 11 real-world task types that are underrepresented or missing in existing benchmarks. The benchmark includes 609 tasks across diverse categories, with the first 8 segments testing single skills or objectives (usually on a single website), and the remaining 3 evaluating more difficult multi-step or cross-site tasks.

#### WebTailBench Detailed Results

*Table: Breakdown of WebTailBench results across all 11 segments. Success rates (%) are averaged over 3 independent runs. Fara-7B achieves the highest performance among computer-use models across all task categories.*

**Coming Soon:**
- Task Verification pipeline for LLM-as-a-judge evaluation
- Official human annotations of WebTailBench (in partnership with BrowserBase)

### Evaluation Infrastructure

Our evaluation setup leverages:

1. **Playwright** - A cross-browser automation framework that replicates browser environments
2. **Abstract Web Agent Interface** - Allows integration of any model from any source into the evaluation environment
3. **Fara-Agent Class** - Reference implementation for running the Fara model

> **Note:** Fara-7B is an experimental release designed to invite hands-on exploration and feedback from the community. We recommend running it in a sandboxed environment, monitoring its execution, and avoiding sensitive data or high-risk domains.

---

# Installation


##  Linux 

The following instructions are for Linux systems, see the Windows section below for Windows instructions. 

Install the package using pip and set up the environment with Playwright:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fara.git
cd fara

# 2. Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[vllm]
playwright install
```

Note: If you plan on hosting with Azure Foundry only, you can skip the `[vllm]` and just do `pip install -e .`


## Windows

For Windows, we highly recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to provide a Linux-like environment. However, if you prefer to run natively on Windows, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fara.git
cd fara

# 2. Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
python3 -m playwright install
```

## Hosting the Model

**Recommended:** The easiest way to get started is using Azure Foundry hosting, which requires no GPU hardware or model downloads. Alternatively, you can self-host with vLLM if you have GPU resources available.

### Azure Foundry Hosting (Recommended)

Deploy Fara-7B on [Azure Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Fara-7B/version/2/registry/azureml-msr) without needing to download weights or manage GPU infrastructure.

**Setup:**

1. Deploy the Fara-7B model on Azure Foundry and obtain your endpoint URL and API key

Then create a endpoint configuration JSON file (e.g., `azure_foundry_config.json`):

```json
{
    "model": "Fara-7B",
    "base_url": "https://your-endpoint.inference.ml.azure.com/",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

Then you can run Fara-7B using this endpoint configuration.

2. Run the Fara agent:

```bash
fara-cli --task "how many pages does wikipedia have" --endpoint_config azure_foundry_config.json [--headful]
```

Note: you can also specify the endpoint config with the args `--base_url [your_base_url] --api_key [your_api_key] --model [your_model_name]` instead of using a config JSON file. 

Note: If you see an error that the `fara-cli` command is not found, then try:

```bash
python -m fara.run_fara --task "what is the weather in new york now"
```

That's it! No GPU or model downloads required.

### Self-hosting with vLLM or LM Studio / Ollama

If you have access to GPU resources, you can self-host Fara-7B using vLLM. This requires a GPU machine with sufficient VRAM (e.g., 24GB or more).

Only on Linux: all that is required is to run the following command to start the vLLM server:

```bash
vllm serve "microsoft/Fara-7B" --port 5000 --dtype auto 
```
For quantized models or lower VRAM GPUs, please see [Fara-7B GGUF on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/microsoft_Fara-7B-GGUF).

For Windows/Mac, vLLM is not natively supported. You can use WSL2 on Windows to run the above command or LM Studio / Ollama as described below.

Otherwise, you can use [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to host the model locally. We currently recommend the following GGUF versions of our models [Fara-7B GGUF on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/microsoft_Fara-7B-GGUF) for use with LM Studio or Ollama. Select the largest model that fits your GPU. Please ensure that context length is set to at least 15000 tokens and temperature to 0 for best results.

Then you can run Fara-7B pointing to your local  server:

Run the test script to see Fara in action:

```bash
fara-cli --task "what is the weather in new york now"
```

If you didn't use vLLM to host, please specify the correct `--base_url [your_base_url] --api_key [your_api_key] --model [your_model_name]`

If you see an error that the `fara-cli` command is not found, then try:

```bash
python -m fara.run_fara --task "what is the weather in new york now"
```

# Reproducibility

We provide a framework in `webeval/` to reproduce our results on WebVoyager and OnlineMind2Web. 
Agentic evaluations on live websites present unique challenges due to day-to-day changes. We implement several measures to ensure reliable and comparable evaluations:

**BrowserBase Integration**
We employ BrowserBase to manage browser session hosting, enabling reliable browser instance management.

**Time-sensitive Task Updates**
Tasks in benchmarks like WebVoyager can become stale or impossible. We:
- Removed ~48 impossible tasks from the original WebVoyager benchmark
- Updated ~50 tasks with future dates to keep them achievable
- Example: *"Search for a hotel in Bali from Jan 1 to Jan 4, 2024"* → *"Search for a hotel in Bali from Jan 1 to Jan 4, 2026"*
- Our updated WebVoyager benchmark is available at `webeval/data/webvoyager/WebVoyager_data_08312025.jsonl`

**Environment Error Handling**
Browser errors (connection drops, page timeouts) are handled robustly:
- Trajectories are retried up to 5 times when environment errors occur
- Complete yet incorrect trajectories are never retried
- Each retry starts with a fresh browser session, with no retained state

**Step Budget**
Each trajectory is capped at a maximum of 100 actions across all online benchmarks. Trajectories exceeding this budget without choosing to stop are considered incorrect.

## WebEval Package Installation

```bash
conda create --name fara_webeval python=3.12
conda activate fara_webeval

# Install fara package (with vllm extras for GPU hosting)
pip install -e .[vllm]

# Install webeval
cd webeval
pip install -e .

# Install playwright
playwright install
```

The webeval package no longer depends on `autogen-core` / `autogen-ext` —
all chat completion clients are vendored under `webeval/src/webeval/oai_clients/`
(see `GracefulRetryClient`, `OpenAIClientWrapper`, `AzureOpenAIClientWrapper`,
etc.). You no longer need to clone or install the autogen submodule.

> **Always activate the `fara_webeval` env before running any of the eval
> scripts below.** It pins `vllm==0.10.0` + `torch==2.7.1`; running with
> a newer `vllm` (≥ 0.19) under `torch` ≥ 2.10 trips a known
> `torch._dynamo.symbolic_convert` crash during CUDA-graph capture, which
> can be worked around with `--enforce_eager` but at a meaningful
> throughput cost. Stick to the pinned env.

## Running Evaluations

Navigate to the scripts directory:

```bash
cd webeval/scripts
```

Make sure you set a valid OpenAI GPT-4o endpoint in `endpoint_configs_gpt4o/dev` in order to run the WebVoyager LLM-as-a-judge! 

**Option 1: Self-hosted vLLM**

```bash
python webvoyager.py --model_url /path/where/you/want/to/download/model/ --model_port 5000 --eval_oai_config ../endpoint_configs_gpt4o/dev/ --out_url /path/to/save/eval/files --device_id 0,1 --processes 1 --run_id 1 --max_rounds 100
python om2w.py --model_url /path/where/you/want/to/download/model/ --model_port 5000 --eval_oai_config ../endpoint_configs_o4/dev/ --eval_model o4-mini --out_url /path/to/save/eval/files --device_id 0,1 --processes 1 --run_id 1 --max_rounds 100

# WebTailBench almost always needs --browserbase: a meaningful share of
# the benchmark's task websites (airlines, retailers, ticketing, …)
# block bot traffic from a vanilla playwright browser. Without
# --browserbase you'll see a high rate of trajectories that abort on
# Page.goto / navigation / captcha errors. Set BROWSERBASE_API_KEY and
# BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID in the environment first.
export BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=<your_browserbase_api_key>
export BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your_browserbase_project_id>

# --success controls which Universal Verifier signal counts as the
# top-line score: ``outcome`` (default; binary outcome_success — what the
# Fara-7B numbers in the README above are reported against), ``process``
# (rubric_is_success := rubric_score >= --rubric_score_threshold; a more
# lenient gate, expect slightly higher numbers), or ``both``.

    --eval-config ../../endpoint_configs/judge_active/prod \
    --judge-model gpt-5.2 --o4mini-model o4-mini \
    --processes 8
```

**Option 2: Azure Foundry Deployment**

Deploy [Fara-7B on Foundry endpoint(s)](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Fara-7B/version/2/registry/azureml-msr), then place endpoint URLs and keys in JSONs under `endpoint_configs/`:

```bash
python webvoyager.py --model_endpoint ../../endpoint_configs/ --eval_oai_config ../endpoint_configs_gpt4o/dev/ --out_url /path/to/save/eval/files --processes 1 --run_id 1_endpoint --max_rounds 100
python om2w.py --model_endpoint ../../endpoint_configs/ --eval_oai_config ../endpoint_configs_o4/dev/ --eval_model o4-mini --out_url /path/to/save/eval/files --processes 1 --run_id 1_endpoint --max_rounds 100
python webtailbench.py --model_endpoint ../../endpoint_configs/ --eval_oai_config ../../endpoint_configs/judge_active/prod --judge_eval_model gpt-5.2 --judge_o4_eval_model o4-mini --out_url /data/data/Fara/eval --processes 1 --run_id 1_endpoint --max_rounds 100
```

### Notes


- We use the same LLM-as-a-judge prompts and model (GPT-4o) as WebVoyager, hence the `--eval_oai_config` argument
- Set `--browserbase` for browser session management (requires exported API key and project ID environment variables)
- Avoid overloading a single vLLM deployment with more than ~10 concurrent processes due to known issues
- See debugging output in `fara/webeval/scripts/stdout.txt`

---

## Analyzing Evaluation Results

### Evaluation Output Structure

Evaluation results are stored under `--out_url` in folders organized by:
- Model name
- Dataset
- Username
- Run ID

Example path:
```
/runs/WebSurfer-fara-100-max_n_images-3/fara-7b/<username>/WebVoyager_WebVoyager_data_08312025.jsonl/<run_id>
```

Each evaluation folder contains:
- `gpt_eval/` - LLM-as-a-judge evaluation results
- `traj/` - Per-task trajectory subdirectories containing:
  - `*-final_answer.json` (e.g., `Amazon--1_final_answer.json`) - `<no_answer>` indicates abortion or step budget exceeded
  - `scores/*_eval.json` - LLM judge scores (`gpt_eval.json` for WebVoyager, `WebJudge_Online_Mind2Web_eval-3.json` for Online-Mind2Web)
  - `web_surfer.log` - Action history and errors
  - `screenshot_X.png` - Screenshots captured before each action X
  - `times.json` - contains start and end times of task
  - `core.log` - contains high level logs like if the trajectory needs to be started or is already cached/done, the evaluation score, duration, and errors encountered

### Running Analysis

Use the analysis notebook to compute metrics:

```bash
cd webeval/scripts/analyze_eval_results/
jupyter notebook analyze.ipynb
```

The script:
- Identifies trajectories aborted mid-execution and diagnostic reasons
- Computes average scores across non-aborted trajectories
- Distinguishes between aborted trajectories (errors during sampling) and completed trajectories (with terminate() call or step budget exceeded)

To re-run failed tasks, execute the evaluation script again with the same `run_id` and `username` - it will skip non-aborted tasks.
